## Details for teaching team
Basic implementation but an excellent learning experience.  I tried to start with a restful AJAX implementation but that approach added too much complexity too soon.  I then went back to a basic routes file implementation and completed the basic requirements.
I look forward to pushing all my route logic to controllers and then models when I revisit this app.  I really like Laravel and can
see this technology would be really fast once I have the basics down.  Thanks for the awesome class!  I really appreciate your help.
